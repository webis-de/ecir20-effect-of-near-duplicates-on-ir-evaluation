Opinion | Is coronavirus really worse than the flu? | NewHamburgIndependent.ca Is coronavirus really worse than the flu? Opinion 08:42 AM by Dr. Nadya Dominique. MD Aurora Banner As the world started hearing more and more about COVID-19, many people started grumbling that it was nowhere near as bad as the flu. So, why all the fuss? Why should we worry? Is COVID-19 really worse than the flu? While the estimated number of flu cases annually is far greater than the number of COVID-19 cases so far, the death rate of COVID-19 is about 3%*, whereas the death rate of the flu is about 0.1%, which means that COVID-19 seems to be about 30* times deadlier than the flu. Let’s crunch some numbers so that we can really see what the fuss is about. As an example, let’s take a look at our neighbours to the south (the numbers work out nicely). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there were approximately 35,000,000 cases of influenza during the 2018/2019 season in the United States. Of that total amount, they estimate about 491,000 hospitalizations and approximately 35,000 deaths. 35,000/35,000,000 = .001 x 100 = 0.1% There’s that 0.1% death rate. For comparison, if we use the same number of total flu cases for the COVID-19 calculation, let’s take a look at what the numbers would be. So, 35 million cases**. What is 3% of 35,000,000? 3/100 = .03 x 35,000,000 = 1,050,000   If exactly the same amount of people who typically get the flu every year get COVID-19, that would mean that there could be more than one million deaths due to COVID-19, compare to 35,000 due to the flu, in the US alone. So, yes, COVID-19 is worse than the flu. That’s what all the fuss is about. Extreme measures are being taken for a reason. * These numbers are based on preliminary research and are subject to change as more people recover and less new cases develop, but it is the generally accepted estimate right now. ** Due to interventions that are being taken throughout the world, the number of coronavirus cases is significantly lower than estimated flu cases.
