As the number of coronavirus cases grows in the U.S., the number of people eligible to give blood for patients in need could decrease further. �We�re asking the American people to help keep the blood supply stable during this challenging time. As communities across the country prepare for this public health emergency, it�s critical that plans include a readily available blood supply for hospital patients,� said Chris Hrouda, Red Cross Blood Services president. �As fears of coronavirus rise, low donor participation could harm blood availability at hospitals, and the last thing a patient should worry about is whether lifesaving blood will be on the shelf when they need it most.� Those interested in donating can make an appointment to donate blood by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting http://RedCrossBlood.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device. Blood donors with type O blood and all platelet donors are especially needed right now. The Red Cross only collects blood from individuals who are healthy and feeling well at the time of donation � and who meet other eligibility requirements, available at http://RedCrossBlood.org. At each blood drive and donation center, Red Cross employees follow thorough safety protocols including wearing gloves, routinely wiping down donor-touched areas, using sterile collection sets for every donation, and preparing the arm for donation with an aseptic scrub. These mitigation measures will help ensure blood recipient safety, as well as staff and donor safety in reducing contact with those who may potentially have this respiratory infection. There is no data or evidence that this coronavirus can be transmissible by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases worldwide of transmissions for any respiratory virus, including this coronavirus, from a transfusion. Nonetheless, the Red Cross has implemented new blood donation deferrals out of an abundance of caution. Individuals are asked to postpone their donation for 28 days following: � Travel to China and its special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Iran, Italy and South Korea. � Diagnosis of COVID-19, contact with a person who has or is suspected to have the virus. As the situation evolves, the Red Cross will continue to evaluate all emerging risks in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and industry partners to determine if additional intervention strategies are needed.

To complete a RapidPass, follow the instructions at http://RedCrossBlood.org/RapidPass or use the Red Cross Blood Donor App. To donate blood, individuals need to bring a blood donor card or driver�s license or two other forms of identification that are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also must meet certain height and weight requirements.
