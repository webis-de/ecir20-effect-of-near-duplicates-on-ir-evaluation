According to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the answer could be “yes.” Advertisement - story continues below The commonplace item that he believes can help reduce risk in the midst of the pandemic is vitamin D. Frieden, who served as CDC director from 2009 to 2017, is now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a firm that works to prevent pandemics and lessen their impacts worldwide. “There are many crackpot claims about miracle cures floating around, but the science supports the possibility — although not the proof — that Vitamin D may strengthen the immune system, particularly of people whose Vitamin D levels are low,” he wrote in a Monday Op-Ed for Fox News.

Adequate Vitamin D may potentially provide some modest protection for vulnerable populations. This is especially important for people who are Vitamin D deficient — and, surprisingly, that might include more than 40 percent of US adults.” Advertisement - story continues below Why might vitamin D be helpful as Americans try to protect themselves? “There is evidence of seasonality in some respiratory illnesses, including influenza and tuberculosis,” Frieden wrote.

Certainly not, Frieden said.

Taking a walk will also help you get physical activity and alleviate cabin fever,” he wrote. “Eat healthy foods that contain or are supplemented with Vitamin D. Take a daily multivitamin supplement (but don’t double the daily dose just because you’re worried).” “Taking a multivitamin that includes Vitamin D, or a Vitamin D supplement, probably can’t hurt,” he noted, “and it might help.” “As we continue to work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, anything we can do to strengthen our resistance is a step in the right direction,” he concluded.
