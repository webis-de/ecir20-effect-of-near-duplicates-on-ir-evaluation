Unfortunately, we‚Äôve learned that the agency has been misleading, and appears to have a peculiar proclivity toward disseminating false information and kowtowing to China‚Äôs authoritarian government. Advertisement - story continues below The WHO, which is part of the United Nations, is now operating with its credibility diminished, and its suggestions relating to the global coronavirus pandemic are under increased scrutiny. So it should come as little surprise that the WHO again dropped the ball on information about the COVID-19 crisis last week, when it was forced to walk back a statement on Twitter that struck a fearful tone about the virus. Reason reported the WHO posted and deleted a tweet Saturday claiming there‚Äôs ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù that people with coronavirus antibodies who have already recovered are immune from the virus. TRENDING: Pennsylvania Takes Hundreds of 'Probable' COVID Deaths Off Books After Coroners Come Forward The tweet accompanied a scientific brief published Friday on so-called ‚Äúimmunity passports‚Äù that weighed whether governments should allow citizens who have recovered from the coronavirus ‚Äî and have antibodies ‚Äî to travel and return to work. ‚ÄúThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,‚Äù the WHO‚Äôs deleted tweet, which was a pull quote from the brief, read. Advertisement - story continues below The misleading tweet initiated a flurry of gloomy news reports. ‚ÄúNo evidence antibodies protect people from second COVID-19 infection, WHO says,‚Äù CBS News reported.

Advertisement - story continues below Nate Silver, the statistician who founded the statistical analysis site FiveThirtyEight, was among those critical of the agency‚Äôs language. ‚ÄúWHO needs to improve its communication on this. When they say ‚Äòno evidence‚Äô they mean something like ‚Äòno definitive proof, yet,'‚Äù Silver wrote. ‚ÄúBut the average person is going to read it as ‚Äòthere‚Äôs no immunity to coronavirus,‚Äô which is likely false and not a good summation of the evidence.‚Äù RELATED: WHO's 'Reckless Dereliction of Duty' and Pro-China Rhetoric Could've Made COVID Much Worse: Experts ‚ÄúThe consensus of the evidence, as best as I can tell, is that there‚Äôs very likely to be some degree of immunity, although we don‚Äôt know how absolute it is and for how long it confers and there‚Äôs still a lot to be learned about it,‚Äù Silver added. The consensus of the evidence, as best as I can tell, is that there‚Äôs very likely to be some degree of immunity, although we don‚Äôt know how absolute it is and for how long it confers and there‚Äôs still a lot to be learned about it. https://t.co/VKIyTMK2Eu ‚Äî Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) April 25, 2020 Advertisement - story continues below Reason‚Äôs Robby Soave also summed up the issue well, pointing out that ‚Äúthe tweet version of the brief was missing important context.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no evidence of immunity. But that‚Äôs because COVID-19 is new and the matter hasn‚Äôt been conclusively studied yet. Scientists have good reason to expect COVID-19 survivors to have some immunity to the virus, though they‚Äôre unsure how strong it will be or how long it will last,‚Äù he wrote. The WHO ended up deleting the irresponsible tweet and issued a clarification. Advertisement - story continues below ‚ÄúEarlier today we tweeted about a new WHO scientific brief on ‚Äòimmunity passports‚Äô. The thread caused some concern & we would like to clarify,‚Äù the WHO tweeted. ‚ÄúWe expect that most people who are infected with #COVID19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection.‚Äù Earlier today we tweeted about a new WHO scientific brief on ‚Äòimmunity passports‚Äô.

Advertisement - story continues below Its credibility has been severely compromised in the eyes of many people seeking facts about a disease that has affected every aspect of life. This is the same agency that cited Chinese authorities when it told the world in January that ‚Äúno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission‚Äù of the virus had been found. Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #Chinaüá®üá≥. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG ‚Äî World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020 Advertisement - story continues below We all know how that information turned out. The WHO damaged itself when it blindly accepted Communist Party of China information about the virus and made itself complicit in the disease becoming the unprecedented global health and economic emergency it is today. Now, it has had to walk back a statement that may have misled people into believing that COVID-19 infections could turn into a never-ending carousel of reinfection and sickness. The WHO dropped the ball on the pandemic from the very beginning, and the ball continues to roll away from of its grasp. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.
