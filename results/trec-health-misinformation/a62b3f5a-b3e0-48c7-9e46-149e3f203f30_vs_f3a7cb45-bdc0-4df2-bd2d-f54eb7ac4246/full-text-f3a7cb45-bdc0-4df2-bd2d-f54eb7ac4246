Bollywood too is making sure to be safe. The makers of Salman Khan-Disha Patani starrer Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai too did their bit by cancelling the Azerbaijan schedule. As per a report in Bollywood Hungama, lead stars Salman and Disha were supposed to shoot for a song in Baku, capital of¬†Azerbaijan. However, this schedule was cancelled to avoid the health risk. The makers also asked some of the crew members who already had reached the location, to return owing to the safety reasons. They are now looking for a new location where the song can be shot.
