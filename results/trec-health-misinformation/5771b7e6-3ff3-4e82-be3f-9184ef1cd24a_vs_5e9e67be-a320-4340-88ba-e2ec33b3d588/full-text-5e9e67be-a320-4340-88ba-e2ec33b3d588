Minister Cele visited the province on Saturday and was accompanied by Deputy Minister Cassel Mathale, the National Commissioner of the SAPS, General Kehla Sitole and Deputy National Commissioner, Lieutenant General Sandile Mfazi, Cele commended the Western Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata and her team, for the swift arrest of 21 suspects, four of whom were allegedly behind the first looting incident at a Shoprite Liquor Store in Langa, Cape Town over the first weekend of the lockdown. The Minister also noted with concern the alleged involvement of police members in some of the liquor related crimes during the lockdown. This follows the arrest of two Warrant Officers from the Delft FCS Unit in the Western Cape. The officers were arrested together with a liquor store manager and a cashier in Strand on Thursday. The arrest follows a tip-off that saw police pounce on the suspects inside the store, buying liquor that was allegedly going to be resold illegally elsewhere. Meanwhile in Mpumalanga, two members stationed at SAPS Pienaar were arrested on Friday night, 10 April 2020 for defeating the ends of justice after the state vehicle they were driving was stopped and found to have been illegally escorting three bakkies, each loaded to capacity with liquor. The three vehicles allegedly belong to a tavern owner who was also arrested with two other drivers for contravening the lockdown regulations in relation to the restriction on the movement of liquor. In line with the SAPS Anti-Corruption Strategy, the National Commissioner, General Sitole sanctioned urgent departmental investigations into the two incidents through which, if found guilty, the members could face dismissal from the service. An urgent meeting between Minister Cele and SAPS management is on the cards where together the police leadership will engage liquor retailers to address this problem and work out a collaborative strategy towards mitigating this emerging risk. The Minister issued a stern warning to those who continue to undermine the efforts of government to curb the spread of the Coronavirus. "The general crime picture since the COVID-19 lockdown continues to reflect a decrease and such incidents must therefore be intercepted and the perpetrators arrested. “Our law abiding citizens must continue to work with law enforcement against criminals as we together ensure the survival of the human race against the COVID-19," said the Minister as he acknowledged the cooperation by the public who continue to give tip-offs. Updates on other arrests and statistics on crime during the lockdown, will be given by the Minister of Police at a later stage. Wrapping up the visit to the Western Cape, Minister Cele commended businesses in Mbekweni and Kraaifontein for playing their part in ensuring that shoppers observe social distancing and have access to sanitisers as they enter and exit the stores. The Minister also noted with concern the high risk of exposure to infections in relation to the positioning of street hawkers who were stationed too close to each other on the pavements, with little attention to the protocols set down for the lockdown. “The Provincial SAPS will engage with the provincial government towards finding a solution to ensuring that licensed vendors operate within the confines of the COVID-19 Disaster Management Lockdown Regulations,” said the Minister. – SAnews.gov.za Share this post:  Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail Most Read SASSA provides food parcel relief 26687 Views 08 Apr 2020 Baby clothes, essentials available for sale during lockdown 19188 Views 09 Apr 2020 COVID-19 regulations limit alcohol sale hours 23564 Views 19 Mar 2020 Minister condemns looting of liquor stores during lockdown 1432 Views 12 Apr 2020 New COVID-19 regulations for funerals 20813 Views 02 Apr 2020 Gauteng COVID-19 cases rise to 813 1456 Views 12 Apr 2020 SA News on Facebook South African Government News 39.3K likes South African Government News3 hours ago [Read] The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has delivered 1 785 water tanks in water-deprived communities across Gauteng to slow the further spread of the novel Coronavirus tinyurl.com/shcm6va Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News3 hours ago [Read] As of today, 12 April 2020, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 2 173, with no reported increase in deaths tinyurl.com/r5garbu Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News7 hours ago [Read] African Union Chairperson President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Dr Donald Kaberuka, Tidjane Thiam and Trevor Manuel as the African Union’s COVID-19 Special Envoys tinyurl.com/uqec255 Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News7 hours ago [Read] Police Minister Bheki Cele has condemned the burglary and looting of at least 16 liquor outlets in the Western Cape since the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown tinyurl.com/vjv578p Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News10 hours ago [Read] Gauteng has a total of 813 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 3 deaths recorded tinyurl.com/qmownyu Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News10 hours ago [Read] The North West Health Department has urged the people of Geelhout Park and Tlhabane in Rustenburg to come out to be screened and tested for COVID-19 tinyurl.com/u2cto5o Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News12 hours ago [Read] The Chief Justice and his Deputy have called on their fellow judicial officers and the broader South African public to show compassion and generosity to those in need during the country’s nationwide lockdown tinyurl.com/wbuzawp Share Facebook Google+ Twitter E-mail View on Facebook South African Government News12 hours ago The law enforcement agencies are currently conducting stop and search in Hillbrow policing precinct.
