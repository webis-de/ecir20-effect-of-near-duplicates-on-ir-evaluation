The study of a sample of coronavirus patients in China, including some who died from the virus, found that people with different blood types showed different reactions when infected.

The research was not peer-reviewed, which means its methodology has not been fully vetted, according to the South China Morning Post. The research found that people with type A blood had more severe symptoms once they were infected than did individuals with type O blood after infection.

The research was conducted by a team of Chinese researchers led by Wang Xinghuan with the Centre for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Coronavirus Study by The Western Journal on Scribd The study, which used the term “Sars-CoV-2” to describe the virus, urged that “infected patients with blood group A might need to receive more vigilant surveillance and aggressive treatment.” Advertisement - story continues below In contrast, it said, “blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease compared with non-O blood groups.” “It might be helpful to introduce ABO blood typing in both patients and medical personnel as a routine part of the management of Sars-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections, to help define the management options and assess risk exposure levels of people,” Wang wrote.

Gao Yingdai, a researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, said the research could be a piece of the eventual medical puzzle but cautioned against reading too much into one study.
