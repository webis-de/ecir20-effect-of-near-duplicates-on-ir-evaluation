While the damage wasn't as bad as further north, this is the third severe mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in five years and the first time the SGBR has been included. Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University Professor Terry Hughes said the 2020 bleaching was severe and more widespread than previous events. "We surveyed 1,036 reefs from the air during the last two weeks in March, to measure the extent and severity of coral bleaching throughout the Barrier Reef region," Mr Hughes said. "For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef, the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors," Prof Hughes said.

This year, February had the highest monthly temperatures ever recorded on the Great Barrier Reef since the Bureau of Meteorology's sea surface temperature records began in 1900. Acting Assistant Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University Professor Morgan Pratchett led underwater surveys to assess the bleaching and said they would return to assess the damage. "In 2020, the cumulative footprint of bleaching has expanded further to include the south," Mr Pratchett said.

"A pale or lightly bleached coral typically regains its colour within a few weeks or months and survives. "We will go back underwater later this year to assess the losses of corals from this most recent event." 0 climate change Read More Login to follow coral bleaching Read More Login to follow great barrier reef Read More Login to follow southern great barrier reef Read More Login to follow climate change coral bleaching great barrier reef southern great barrier reef Subscriber Exclusives premium_icon Mum’s visa at risk after coronavirus job loss News ‘I’ve worked here for four years self-employed and not asked for a cent from anybody, I look after myself’ 4 premium_icon Hope for Whitsundays’ reefs after third mass bleaching News After the hottest February on record since 1900, the reefs around the region are luckily not the hardest hit. premium_icon What you CAN still do under COVID-19 restrictions Community 11 activities to keep you occupied in Mackay while still abiding by government rules 5 premium_icon Police crack down on juvenile offenders Crime Up to a dozen children were arrested in Mackay in relation to alleged property crime and car thefts 4 premium_icon Coronavirus sparks idea for innovative new product Business Mackay company’s idea allows customers to shop safely amid the global pandemic. premium_icon Mining boss responds to COVID-19 safety concerns News As the impact of COVID-19 is felt around the world, a mining boss has revealed his thoughts on tough new FIFO travel restrictions.
