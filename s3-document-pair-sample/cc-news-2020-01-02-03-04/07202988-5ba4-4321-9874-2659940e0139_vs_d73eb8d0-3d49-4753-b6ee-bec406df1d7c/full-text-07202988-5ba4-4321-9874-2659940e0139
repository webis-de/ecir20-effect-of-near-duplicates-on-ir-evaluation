Garlic View this post on Instagram 🧄G A R L I C🧄 Since many of us are home right now, one of the best things we can do to take care of our ourselves and our families and to just stay occupied, is to cook. One of the oldest remedios for stimulating the body’s immune system is garlic. You can make simple soups, salsas, stir-fries or even if your making pasta sauce from a jar, throw in lots of fresh garlic. Raw garlic is the most potent but cooking it still works great. You can also tincture it or make a garlic-honey where you just chop it up real fine like I did here, stir it into some honey and take a spoon full a day.

Cayenne View this post on Instagram Repost - Follow my other page ⬇⬇⬇ @naturedoctor_beautytips Cayenne pepper has so many amazing health benefits, I try to incorporate it into as many recipes as possible. It also works as an energizing herb in herbal tonics..similar to a battery...it sparks the synergistic action of other herbs it is combined with. It is very warming to the entire body so will increase circulation and metabolism - making it helpful when wanting to shed excess body fat as it improves cardiovascular performance. Cayenne's warming ability makes it a very beneficial herb to incorporate into a detox program; it burns off mucus and helps expel toxins from the body. It is also wonderful to consume when fighting off a cold, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia..etc. as it can help induce a fever and sweating to help the body kill off viral or bacterial invaders and heal faster. It is great for pain relief in the back and joints and can be applied topically within an ointment. Dr. Christopher the world renowned herbalist/naturopath who taught Dr. Schulze and who designed the 'Mucusless Diet', promoted the use of cayenne and discussed its benefits in all his books. He recommended 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper 3 times per day in water...starting in the morning. He said to begin with 1/4 teaspoon and work up to 1 teaspoon 3 times per day. He also recommended apple cider vinegar and raw honey in 8 oz of water 3 times per day along with kelp, molasses and wheat germ oil. The cayenne pepper along with these revitalizing healing aids, (and avoiding toxic mucus forming foods such as dairy, sugar, fast food, fried foods..etc.,) help build up strength in the body while they start cutting the mucus out of the tissues and eliminating the catarrh from the system. Each day the body will become stronger, the cells cleaner and better able to function while overall health is improved. #drholistichealth #cayenne #cayennepepper #arthritis #heartdisease #fibromyalgia #nervepain #chronicpain #chronicfatigue #capsicum #holisticnutrition #herbalremedy #herbalhealing #digestion #farmacy A post shared by Functional Holistic Medicine (@dr_holistic_health) on Jan 26, 2019 at 7:35am PST 10.

Sea Kelp View this post on Instagram 💚💚Thrive Sea Kelp! 🌱💚💚 WHY does Big Country Raw recommend this supplement? ✅Kelp works by filling in micronutrient deficiencies and balancing minerals. This can provide pet parents with peace of mind that their pets raw or home cooked meals contain all the trace minerals essential for a complete diet. ✅Thrive Sea Kelp contains bioavailable minerals, vitamins, and beneficial phytonutrients, which are important for healthy metabolic function including digestion, skin and coat health, and immune response. WHAT ELSE? ✅Kelp is ideal for balancing glandular functioning in dogs. Iodine is essential for stimulating the thyroid gland. This can benefit animals who suffer from hypothyroidism. ✅Some lesser know features of these foods include phycolour enhancement for hair coats and pigment. Regular supplementation can help result in richer and deeper eye, nose and cost colour. ✅Kelp can also provide potential cancer protection. Some studies have shown that seaweeds may be helpful in reducing cancer and they are thought to contain anti-tumor properties. 🥄Recommended dosage is 1/4 tsp per 25 lb. body weight fed daily. This supplement is suitable for both dogs & cats. 🐕🐈 We suggest all our Pure Formula’s and Blends be supplemented with Thrive Kelp. Dinner formulas already contain kelp, so additional supplementation is not necessary.

Oregano Oil View this post on Instagram Happy February! Candida update: patiently waiting for my consult with Evan Brand on 2/22. Until then still following a candida diet protocol and supplementing. One in particular is oregano oil. Oregano oil is one of my favorite staples for gut health, fighting colds, and keeping inflammation down. Oregano oil is powerful, it contains compounds to treat foot and nail fungus, kill parasites, and alleviate colds and infections. • My favorite way to use it is in tincture form like you see here, mixed with some water but can also be used topically mixed with a carrier oil like coconut oil. The predominant healing compound found in oregano is carvacrol, which has been highly studied in scientific literature. Along with the compound thymol, the carvacrol in oregano oil has been shown to have strong anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Oregano oil also contains nutrients like Vitamin A, C, and E, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, potassium, manganese, copper, boron, and niacin. • This potent herb is amazing for replacing antibiotics aiding in healing bacterial infections, fungal infections, parasites, viruses, etc. Great for the gut, oregano oil can help balance bacteria and fight yeast overgrowth making it a natural treatment for candida and SIBO! • Due to oregano oils power, do not take for extended periods of time and consult with your medical professional before taking. What other herbal tinctures do you swear by?
